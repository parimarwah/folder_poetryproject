You wake up in an unfamiliar bedroom, that looks as if it was lifted straiight from the set of a bad Jane Austen adaptation from the 2000s. 
The bed is ridiculously poofy and the walls around you are exceedingly and cloyingly ornate. 
You hear commotion outside the wide mahogany doors. Do you stay in your room or check out whats outside?
