You decide to go find your twin Artemis. If this world follows the same principles as the movie, you are the most powerful with your twin by your side, after all.  "Ileana...right? I'm going to go find Artemis! I want to make sure she's, you know, up and all that. You know how she likes to sleep in, moon powers and all that!" 
You manage to squeeze out of her grasp and giggle awkwardly as you make your escape. 
After several unsucessful attempts and stumbling in on Karsh reapplying his eyeliner in the bathroom, you manage to find Artemis's room. 
You find her sleeping on an equally ridiculous bed, her pen and journal still in hand. 
Suddenly, you see a stream of dark smoke start to emerge from under her bathroom door. 
It's the Darkness! You run over to Tia Mowry- I mean, Artemis, and shake her awake. 
She starts to hit you with her journal but stops when you gseture to the smoke. 
"Oh god, not again." she says with a yawn. She grabs your hand, and blast of white light shoots through the room, vanquishing the smoke. 
"They need to come up with something better if they want a Twitches 3" she says before she goes back to sleep. 
You heave a sigh of relief and make your way back to your room to get ready for the ball. 
Maybe living in the mid 2000s setting of a hit Disney Channel Original movie isn't so bad... you don't have to worry about getting a job or if you've been doing your taxes right, Turbo Tax free version seems a little too good to be true right?
