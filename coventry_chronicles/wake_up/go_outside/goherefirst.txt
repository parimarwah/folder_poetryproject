You decide to go venture outside, you seem to be in a dream, it couldn't hurt to explore this weird world, right?
As you open the door, you see a woman dressed in an orange flouncy dress. 
She meets your eyes and rushes over to you with urgency. She grabs your hand and whisks you away back into the bedroom,closing the door behind her.
"Make haste, Apolla! Have you forgotten about the ball? Everybody in Coventry is going to be rushing to take a look at their future princess,
and here you are sleeping the day away". 
She furiously starts combing out your hair after wrestling you into a chair in front of the vanity. 
Artemis? Coventry? Have you somehow been transorted into the plot of 2005 Disney Channel original Twitches? 
What do you do next, go find your twin sister Artemis or go with the flow  for now?
